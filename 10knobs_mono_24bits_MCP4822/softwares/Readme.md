  - Hardware_check: a test sketch for the PCB integrity
  - MCP4922_mono_24bits_SPI2_trimming: a sketch to trim the synth with an oscilloscope (should give a straight line)
  - XORAND_sax_mk2: a remake of the XORAND_sax synth (from the 8k serie): a synth to be used with an EWI. This is a good base if you want to start your own synth.
